        <p class="intro">
            It all started with a laptop I found in the trash ‚Äî broken screen, dust everywhere, 
            but surprisingly powerful under the hood. Instead of tossing it aside, I saw a challenge:
            could I turn this forgotten machine into something valuable?
        </p>

            <h2>First Boot: Wrestling with Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>
                With no Ethernet port, the first hurdle was just getting Ubuntu Server online. 
                I spent a while battling <code>wpa_supplicant</code>, because setting up WiFi connectivity on a laptop with a half-broken screen is no easy task.
                Later on I was able to acquire a USB-C Ethernet adapter made streaming far more stable. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection">
                Looking back, it hadn't occurred to me to use a USB-C Ethernet adapter until I came across one.
                That tiny adapter made such a difference ‚Äî it's often the simple solutions that work best.

            <h2>Locking the Doors: SSH Hardening</h2>
            <p>
                Exposing a server to the internet without care is like leaving your house unlocked. 
                I leaned heavily on <a href="https://sshaudit.com/" target="_blank">SSHaudit</a> to guide me. 
                Password logins were gone, replaced with keys. Weak ciphers like <code>arcfour</code> and 
                <code>cbc</code> were stripped away. Only strong modern ones remained, 
                such as <code>chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and aes256-gcm@openssh.com</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection">
                It was here I realized how dangerous defaults can be. 
                Even updated software carry legacy baggage due to compatability and unless need them you should remove them.
            </p>

        <section class="story-block">
            <h2>Discovering Jellyfin</h2>
            <p>
                Installing Jellyfin was a turning point. Suddenly, this trash laptop was no longer just a 
                server ‚Äî it was a private streaming platform.

            <p class="reflection">
                This was the ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment: seeing a dead machine reborn with a purpose.

            <h2>TLS and the Joy of Automation</h2>
            <p>
                At first, I played with self-signed certificates, but the real breakthrough was 
                setting up Certbot with automatic renewal via <code>systemd</code>. 
                Suddenly, security wasn't something I had to remember ‚Äî it was just there, quietly doing its job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, moving behind Cloudflare not only added resilience thanks to WAF and DDoS protection but also
                protected my server's IP address from being exposed.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection">
                The lesson? Automation is more than convenience ‚Äî it's peace of mind.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="story-block">
            <h2>Adding the Extras</h2>
            <p>
                With the basics solid, I couldn't resist: Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr came next. 
                They automated media handling via Usenet (what else did you think? üòâ). 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection">
                The ecosystem grew organically ‚Äî each tool taught me a little more about 
                networking, automation, and system monitoring.
            </p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Old hardware isn't worthless ‚Äî it's an opportunity to learn and create something useful.</li>
                <li>Defaults can be dangerous; hardening is important, don't blindly trust defaults.</li>
                <li>Security and convenience can coexist ‚Äî if you design for both.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the end, I am really happy with my server. I use it regularly with friends to watch movies together. However it was more than just a media server project. 
                It was a reminder of why I love cybersecurity: 
                finding the balance between building something useful and making it secure.
