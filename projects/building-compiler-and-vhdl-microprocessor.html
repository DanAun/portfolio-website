        <h2>Building a C-like Compiler and VHDL Microprocessor</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my coursework in Automatas & Languages and Hardware Architecture at INSA Toulouse,
            I embarked on an exciting project to develop a complete system that includes a compiler for a simplified C-like language and a microprocessor designed in VHDL to execute the generated machine code.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The project is divided into two main components:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Compiler</h4>
        <p>
            The compiler component includes both lexical and syntax analysis:
        </p>

        <h5>Lexical Analysis</h5>
        <p>
            Implemented using Flex, the lexical analyzer scans the source code to identify specific tokens such as arithmetic operators, keywords (like <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>), numbers, comments and brackets.
            In short it breaks the source code into tokens that are then passed to the syntax analyzer for further processing.
        </p>

        <h5>Syntax Analysis</h5>
        <p>
            Utilizing Bison, the syntax analyzer processes the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer.
            It checks the structure of the source code against defined grammar rules, ensuring the syntactic correctness of the code.
            The syntax analyzer then translates the source code into corresponding assembly code, preparing it for execution by the microprocessor.
        </p>
        
        <h4>2. VHDL Microprocessor</h4>
        <p>
            The microprocessor, designed using VHDL, follows a RISC architecture with a 5-stage pipeline.
            This architecture supports essential operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and data transfer.
            The pipeline design optimizes performance by allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages.
            Additionally we implemented a hazard detection mechanisms to manage data, control, and structural conflicts.
